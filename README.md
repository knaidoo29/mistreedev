# MiSTree Development

The functions are in development and may be removed and altered at any time. Code
which works well and has been robustly tested will eventually make its way into
the main MiSTree python package. Functions may not work as you think they do. If you
see something potentially useful, contact me and I can let you know whether the function
works and how to use it.

Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/knaidoo29/mistreedev.git
cd mistreedev
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

Importing:

```
import mistreedev as mistdev
```
